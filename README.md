# Login

## Introduction
This is a simple C program for login feature.

## Prerequisites
There are two files. One files stores the valid usernames, another stores valid password corresponding to the username.

## How it works?
When user enters username, the program parses the file and searches for username in the file. Then if username is present it prompts
for password. If the password corresponding to the username is same, then the user is given access to rest of the content.
